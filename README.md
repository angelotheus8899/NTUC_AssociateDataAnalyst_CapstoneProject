# Problem Statement
**IMDb (Internet Movie Database)** is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, and video games, and streaming content online -- including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, fan reviews, and ratings.

The **IMDb score** (or IMDb rating) is a numerical rating assigned to movies, TV shows, and other video content on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). It is designed to reflect how much audiences like or dislike a particular title. IMDb users rate movies on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 = terrible and 10 = excellent. These ratings are not a simple average. IMDb uses weighted average algorithm to prevent manipulation by spam or biased voting.
